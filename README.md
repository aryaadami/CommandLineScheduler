# CommandLineScheduler
## An incomplete initiative to create a command-line scheduler for university. Probably won't ever finish this. Run instructions in README file.

## How to run:
1. Download all the files and place them in a folder.
2. Ensure you have a version of python3 installed.
3. Open CMD or Terminal. On Windows, type _pip install colorama_. On MacOS, type _python -m pip install colorama_.
**NB: On MacOS, you may have to start with python3 instead of just python.**
4. Double click the _main_ file to run the program. Enjoy!
**NB: The _print overview_ functionality only works on Windows machines.**
