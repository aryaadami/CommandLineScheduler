# CommandLineScheduler
### To download click on _Code_ then _Download ZIP_.
### An incomplete initiative to create a command-line scheduler for university. It is missing a lot of scheduling functionality and only functions as a to-do list currently, but it is is very unlikely that I will return to finish it. The setup instructions are below.

## Setup instructions:
1. Download all the files and place them in a folder.
2. Ensure you have a version of python3 installed.
3. Ensure you have a version of pip installed. If necessary, update to the latest version of pip using **_pip3 install --upgrade pip_**.
4. Open CMD or Terminal. On Windows, type _**pip install colorama**_. On MacOS, type _**python3 -m pip install colorama**_.
**NB:** On MacOS, you may need to use the_python_ command instead of _python3_.
5. **To run the program**, right click _**main.py**_ and open it with python launcher (if this does not already happen by default).
**NB:** The **_print overview_** functionality only works on Windows machines. Nevertheless, you can still manually print the generated .txt file.

**Enjoy!**
