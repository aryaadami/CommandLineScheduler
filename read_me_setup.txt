Setup instructions:

1. Download all the files and place them in a folder.
2. Ensure you have a version of python3 installed.
3. Ensure you have a version of pip installed. If necessary,
    update to the latest version of pip using pip3 install --upgrade pip.
4. Open CMD or Terminal. On Windows, type pip install colorama.
    On MacOS, type python3 -m pip install colorama.
    NB: On MacOS, you may need to use the_python_ command instead of python3.
5. To run the program, right click main.py and open it with python
    launcher (if this does not already happen by default).
    On Windows this should happen by default when you double-click.
    NB: The print overview functionality only works on Windows machines.
    Nevertheless, you can still manually print the generated .txt file.

Enjoy!
